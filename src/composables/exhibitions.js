// The exhibition tree — exhibitions → themes → chapters — replaces the
// hand-written parent_id walk this file used to be part of (the
// historical-background and profiles subtrees' own walk moved the same way,
// into composables/history.js, #39).
//
// `childType` is depth-indexed against THIS tree's own root, the
// exhibitions-root marker — not against "an exhibition" as viewer-core's own
// doc comment's two-element example (`['theme', 'subtheme']`) illustrates.
// The marker's children are a level this site's other trees don't have: the
// exhibitions themselves. Verified against the package directly (see the
// pull request description) — a two-element array leaves every node
// unfiltered from depth 2 on, which reads as "every type", but
// `useCollectionTree`'s `children(id)` indexes by the DEPTH OF THE PARENT
// being listed, not of the children returned, so depth 0 (the marker)
// governs the exhibitions themselves: a two-element array filters the
// exhibitions to type `theme` and finds none, and the tree comes back
// empty. Three elements — one per level below the marker — is what this
// tree's own shape needs; it also doubles as the National Context filter:
// the country-specific "National Context" collections sit next to the real
// themes under an exhibition but carry type `collection`, not `theme`, so
// filtering an exhibition's children to `theme` keeps them out.

// marker this tree hangs from is itself nested a level under the package's
// project collection (the importer's sh-exhibition-root-keying step, #1505),
// so the true ancestry of every exhibition, theme and chapter carries two
// extra, unrelated crumbs — the project collection and the marker itself —
// ahead of "exhibition › theme". Bounded here to the marker, once, so every
// consumer (the specs' `route`, EssayView's own breadcrumb) sees only
// exhibition-relative ancestry.
//
// Returns `null` for a node that is not under the marker at all — the
// cross-link scans below need to tell that apart from "this node IS the
// exhibition" (an empty, but real, ancestry).
