// The website's records, read the one way every website reads them: through
// viewer-core, lazily. Each entity is a shared ref that stays `null` until a
// route declaring it in `meta.entities` brings its chunk in, so importing
// this module loads nothing, and a page pays only for what it reads.
// Translations are viewer-core's cache, not a second one kept here. The
// wrapper half — `tr`, `md`/`mdInline`/`mdStrip`, `loadEnglish`, `labelOf`,
// the visible form of an entity — is `useCatalogueData`'s; what stays here is
// this site's own: the hand-written exhibition list/theme lookup the
// catalogue facets and timeline pages still read (the six exhibition pages
// themselves read the `useCollectionTree` form in exhibitions.js instead),
// and the raw item lookup a page reads when it deliberately shows an item
// the visible rule below hides.

// Items legacy kept only to illustrate Historical Background / timeline
// pages (display_status 'N') are excluded from database search and Permanent
// Collection browsing, exactly like the legacy site
// (modules/database_results.php AND o.display_status='A'). Declared once,
// as `visible.items`, so `items`/`catalogue.entity('items')` read it
// automatically. Exported too (as `itemVisible`, from `useInventoryData()`):
// viewer-core's own generic entity access — the keyword index,
// `useFeaturedRecord`, this site's own catalogue spec's `scope` — reads the
// raw entity by name and applies no site rule of its own, so each of those
// needs the rule directly, the way `catalogue.js`'s `inScope` re-exports it.
//
// The Historical Background/Profiles subtrees this file used to walk by
// hand now live in composables/history.js, over `useCollectionTree` —
// #39, following the exhibition tree's own move in #37/#38.

// sh-exhibition-root-keying step, #1505). From that anchor: exhibitions are
// its children, themes are an exhibition's children, and — unlike the mwnf3
// datasets — a theme's children are SUBTHEMES ("Chapters" in the legacy UI),
// a full third narrative level with its own intro, quotation and item grid.
//
// Section anchors are resolved by `purpose` (#1505); backward_compatibility
// is informational only and never load-bearing here.

// The data package is single-context (one SH project), so each `*-root`
// purpose occurs at most once.

//
// SH timelines are per (country × exhibition), each bound to its exhibition

// Collection timeline" (hidden sentinel exhibition 2 — remapped by the

// exhibition, with a thematic-vs-Permanent-Collection toggle.

// feature a given item ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// No separate export is needed for this: collections.json already lists
// each collection's items[] (used to render Artistic Introduction pages and
// Exhibition theme/page grids), so "which collections reference this item"
// is just a client-side reverse lookup over the same data. See Epic 12 in
// the islamicart parity backlog.

// The reverse lookup — which exhibitions/themes/chapters an item is
// attached to — is now `exhibitionTree.containing(itemId)` (every collection
// that carries the item directly, exhibition tree or not) narrowed by
// `exhibitionAncestry`, which is `null` for a hit outside the exhibitions
// tree (a Historical Background page can carry the same item) and the
// node's exhibition-relative ancestry otherwise: `[]` for an item attached
// to the exhibition itself, one theme for an item on a theme, two for an
// item on a chapter.
